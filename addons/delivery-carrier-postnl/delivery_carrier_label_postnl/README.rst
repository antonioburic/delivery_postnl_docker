Delivery carrier PostNL
========================

This module adds an implementation of PostNL as a delivery carrier.
===================================================================

The system is able to add and compute the shipping line when 
PostNL is set as a delivery carrier on the sale order/picking,
as well as creates a shipment through the API and generates 
shipping labels.
